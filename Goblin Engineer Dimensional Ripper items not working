Hello

I crafted the following two items today from Goblin Engineering,  [Dimensional Ripper - Everlook],  [Dimensional Ripper - Area 52]. 
When i try and use the items it says "The item cannot be equipped". The items dosent show a cooldown, and it should not start on cooldown just after being crafted. Items like Moll-E and Workhole Generator did not work like that either. 
I am Goblin Engineer skill 450, i have tryed deleing my catch, relogging etc. many times with no result. 

I talked to GM Tide ingame and he asked me to post the big here. 

Hope you will take a look at this :)

Regards Eldra
